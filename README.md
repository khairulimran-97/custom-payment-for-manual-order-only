# WooCommerce Manual Payment Gateways Plugin

This is a WordPress plugin that adds two new payment methods, "Pay via Whatsapp" and "Pay via Shoppe", for manual orders only in WooCommerce. The plugin uses the WooCommerce Payment Gateway API to define the new payment methods and adds them to the list of available gateways if manual orders are being placed in the store.

## Installation

1. Install the "Code Snippet" plugin in your WordPress site.
2. Copy the code from `index.php` in this repository.
3. Go to the WordPress admin panel and navigate to Snippets > Add New.
4. Paste the code into the "Code" field and enter a title for the snippet.
5. Set the "Run snippet everywhere" option to "Yes" and click "Save Changes and Activate".

The new payment methods, "Pay via Whatsapp" and "Pay via Shoppe", will now be available for manual orders in the WooCommerce checkout process.
